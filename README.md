## Self-evaluation of Web Programming Skills
I have a good knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, with basic skills in JavaScript, acquired during the SAW course. I have worked on simple and interactive website projects, but I haven't programmed in these languages for a while. At the moment, I have no knowledge of JSON, GeoJSON, and d3.js.
