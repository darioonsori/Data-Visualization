## Self-evaluation of Web Programming Skills
I have a good knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, with basic skills in JavaScript, acquired during the SAW course. I have worked on simple and interactive website projects, but I haven't programmed in these languages for a while. At the moment, I have no knowledge of JSON, GeoJSON, and d3.js.
## Technologies for Web Programming
- **HTML5**: I will use HTML5 to structure the website's content and layout.
- **CSS3**: CSS3 will be used to style the website and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Basic JavaScript will be used for handling interactivity and user input on the site.
- **D3.js**: I plan to use D3.js to create interactive data visualizations, which will allow for the manipulation and display of the global environmental data.
- **Bootstrap**: If necessary, I may use Bootstrap to ensure the site is responsive and looks good on different devices.
